# Fake vs. Real Image Classification
This project is designed to classify images as fake or real using machine learning techniques. The project involves processing two datasets obtained from Kaggle, applying preprocessing steps, and training a classification model in the Google Colab environment.

The full project is hosted on GitHub and can be accessed here.

# Features
Utilizes two Kaggle datasets for a robust classification task.
Data preprocessing includes image resizing, normalization, and splitting into training and testing sets.
A machine learning model (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network) is trained to distinguish between fake and real images.
Conducted entirely in Google Colab for accessible and efficient computation.

# Workflow
## Data Collection

Two datasets are downloaded from Kaggle containing fake and real images.
## Preprocessing

Images are resized and normalized for consistency.
The data is split into training and testing sets to ensure reliable evaluation.
## Model Training

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or other appropriate machine learning model is used.
The model is trained on Google Colab, utilizing GPU acceleration for faster training.
## Evaluation

The model is tested on unseen data to evaluate its performance.
Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.
